# Final release preparation report

**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Purpose:** Prepare repository for public release — clean structure, no AI traces, neutral docs, hardened .gitignore.

---

## ✅ Completed tasks

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| **A — Remove all AI tooling traces** | ✅ No Cursor, Windsurf, “Generated by AI”, “Co-authored-by”, or ChatGPT references found in source, docs, or scripts. .cursor/, .windsurf/, .ai/ added to .gitignore. |
| **B — Clean repo structure** | ✅ Removed `test.log`, `run_bench_smoke_twice.sh` (moved to `scripts/`), `docs/RenamePlan_UIStreamKit.md`. Kept source, tests, scripts/, Benchmarks/, README, FINAL_REPORT. |
| **C — Harden .gitignore** | ✅ Added: *.xctestrun, *.xcresult, *.xcarchive, *.log, Artifacts/, Benchmarks/Results/* with !Benchmarks/Results/.gitkeep, __pycache__/, *.pyc, .venv/, .cursor/, .windsurf/, .ai/. Created Benchmarks/Results/.gitkeep. |
| **D — Clean all documentation** | ✅ Replaced “best results” → “optimal results”, “best used” → “recommended for”. Added ## Benchmarking section to README with smoke/full commands, artifact path, and “results depend on device/simulator” note. Removed unverified performance claims; artifact links point to Benchmarks/Results/<run_id>/. |
| **E — FINAL_REPORT.md validation** | ✅ Contains: (1) what changed, (2) exact smoke/full commands, (3) environment details, (4) artifact paths, (5) “What is proven / not proven”. Added note: “Some smoke scenarios may be sensitive to simulator scheduling; full benchmark runs provide authoritative results.” |
| **F — Verify benchmark pipeline** | ✅ Smoke script: .derivedData/smoke, deletes at start, builds fresh, logs xctestrun path. Full script: .derivedData/full, persists to Benchmarks/Results/<run_id>. Parser: generates SUMMARY.md and REPORT.md. Scripts are production-level. |
| **G — Final sanity check** | ✅ git status / git ls-files: no DerivedData, .build, or logs tracked; no .cursor/.windsurf in repo; .gitignore prevents them. |

## 📁 Files removed

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `test.log` | Temp/debug log at repo root. |
| `run_bench_smoke_twice.sh` | Moved to `scripts/run_bench_smoke_twice.sh` for consistent layout. |
| `docs/RenamePlan_UIStreamKit.md` | Internal/experimental rename plan; not needed for public release. |

---

## 🧹 Files cleaned

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.gitignore` | Added Xcode/Swift (*.xctestrun, *.xcresult, *.xcarchive), *.log, Artifacts/, Benchmarks/Results/* and .gitkeep exception, Python (__pycache__, .venv), .cursor/, .windsurf/, .ai/. |
| `README.md` | Added ## Benchmarking (smoke/full commands, artifact path, device/simulator note). Replaced “best results” → “optimal results”. Updated artifact references to Benchmarks/Results/<run_id>. Updated run_bench_smoke_twice references to `scripts/run_bench_smoke_twice.sh`. |
| `docs/ECOSYSTEM_AND_PLATFORMS.md` | “best used” → “recommended for” (neutral wording). |
| `FINAL_REPORT.md` | Added simulator-scheduling note in “What this proves / what it doesn’t”. |

## 📄 Docs updated

- **README.md** — Benchmarking section, neutral wording, artifact paths.
- **docs/ECOSYSTEM_AND_PLATFORMS.md** — Neutral wording.
- **FINAL_REPORT.md** — Simulator scheduling caveat.

---

## 🔒 AI traces removed

- **Search:** No occurrences of “Cursor”, “Windsurf”, “Generated by AI”, “Co-authored-by”, “ChatGPT”, or “AI assistant” in source, README, docs, or scripts (excluding third-party checkouts under .derivedData/.build, which are gitignored).
- **.gitignore:** `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.ai/` added so any such dirs are never committed.
- **Confirmation:** No AI tooling references remain in the committed codebase.

---

## 🚀 Repo status

**Ready for public release:** **YES**

- No AI tooling traces in tracked content.
- No unverified performance claims in docs.
- Repo is clean and professional: source, tests, scripts, Benchmarks, README, FINAL_REPORT; temp/debug/experimental files removed.
- .gitignore prevents DerivedData, logs, Artifacts, and generated Benchmark results from being committed; Benchmarks/Results/.gitkeep keeps the directory.
- Benchmark pipeline is unchanged and verified (smoke/full scripts and parser).

**Recommended next step:** Stage and commit the changes, then push:

```bash
git add .gitignore README.md FINAL_REPORT.md docs/ECOSYSTEM_AND_PLATFORMS.md \
  scripts/ Benchmarks/Results/.gitkeep
git add -u   # stages deletions (run_bench_smoke_twice.sh, test.log, docs/RenamePlan_UIStreamKit.md)
# If you have other modified files (e.g. BenchmarkScenariosTests.swift, MockURLProtocol.swift, BenchTestObserver, BenchmarkTimeout) from prior work, add as needed.
git status   # verify
git commit -m "Release prep: clean structure, neutral docs, hardened .gitignore, benchmark scripts in scripts/"
```
